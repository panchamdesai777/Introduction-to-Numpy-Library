### Project Overview

 TItle : Make sense of census . This project generally helps to get familiar with numpy programming skills . The major part of project revolvevs around analysing and management of the Census record.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I had a better grip on working with numpy. In this project, I had applied the following concepts:

1. Array Appending

2. Array Slicing

3. Array Filtering

4. Array Aggregation


### Approach taken to solve the problem
1. In this first task, I had to load the data to a numpy array and add a new record to it.

2. Simple Analysis of age distribution.

3.Analysing the Race Distribution of country provided in the dataset.

4.check the data to see if the senior citizen aged more than 60 yrs were made to work more than 25 hrs per week.
